## Why did I create this?
Not having to deal with clicking every few hours while earning a passive income with NFT games is deal breaker for me and since there isn't something such as that. Why not take a game and automate it?

In the program you will need to do some configurations, following are configurations you'd need to gather from the game, since this bot is not ran upon private key.

//

`API_KEY`:
Which can be found in any of the requests in the console "Network" tab after filtering all requests with "/v1/" in the [game](https//medium-rare-potato.io/).
